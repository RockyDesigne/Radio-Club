# Radio-Club
It is my first try at a responsive website. It is a fictional website.
It is a project from codecademy. The idea was to create a website for a fictional club.
This is what i managed to achieve i know it isn't much but i have only started coding two weeks ago.
Any advice is apreciated. One thing i didn't manage to achieve was to make the text beneath the images scale how i wanted to.
Any advice on that is much apreciated thanks for reading this.
